## Masm Notes

Micro-Assembly has some *"weird"* syntax rules when it comes to it's use of dollar signs ($) and hashtags (#) for memory addresses and label references.

Micro-Assembly is no short of being a funky language to learn and of course has some issues with certain things.


a full list of references for the language rules can be found in the [reference.md](reference.md) file on your system or through github by clicking the link in blue.


Certain people have "*tried*" to change the way Micro-Assembly looks and acts behind the hood. 

coming from (@charlie-sans the head developer and CEO/Owner of Finite), we will __never__ change the way MASM looks.
instructions will act the same, look and "feel" the same regardless of things.

though language specs might change the way things feel or look, so we can't push a "yes it will be the same" and expect things to work.
